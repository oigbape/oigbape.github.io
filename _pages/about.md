## 🚀 Featured Projects
I’ve been fortunate to 
- **Build**: Urbanization Trend Analysis, SQL Injection Defense System, IoT Highway Safety Predictor     
- **Explore**: Cloud systems, Cybersecurity and Privacy-preserving tech like zero-knowledge proofs through hands-on projects  
- **Learn**: From amazing peers and professors about AI/ML, NLP, LLM's, Data Engineering

### 🔒 Anonymous Age Verification   
A zero-knowledge credential system using Rust and zkSNARKs to prove age ≥21 without revealing birthdates (zkcreds demo).  
Tech: Rust, Groth16, Merkle Trees, Poseidon Hash 

### 🔐 Applied Cybersecurity   
Demonstrated exploitation and mitigation of memory corruption (buffer overflows, format strings), cryptographic flaws (AES/RSA, PRNGs, padding oracles), and system vulnerabilities (Set-UID, PKI) in controlled labs.
Tech: C, Python, GDB, OpenSSL, ASLR/NX bypass, Linux

### 📊 Urbanization Trend Analysis  
Visualized demographic shifts across 15+ metrics using interactive D3.js choropleth maps and Tableau dashboards.  
Tech: D3.js, Tableau, Flask, Python  

### 🛡️ SQL Injection Defense System  
Deployed hybrid detection model (signature + anomaly) blocking  30+ SQLi variants (e.g., UNION-based, blind SQLi, hex-encoded payloads), achieving 100% detection/blocking accuracy.  
Tech: PHP, MySQL, Apache, .htaccess

### 🤖 IoT Highway Safety Predictor  
Co-developed Bayesian accident-risk model (AUC-ROC: 0.82) published in peer-reviewed journal *IJRIAS*.  
Tech: Python, ESP8266, Bayesian Learning
