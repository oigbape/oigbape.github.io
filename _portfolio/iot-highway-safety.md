## Objective
To develop a predictive system leveraging IoT and Bayesian learning to enhance road safety and reduce accidents on the Benin-Onitsha Express Way, Nigeria, addressing the problem of frequent accidents.

## My Role & Contributions
* Contributed to the design of the IoT framework for real-time data collection from vehicles (location, speed) and road conditions.
* Involved in the analysis of **[e.g., three years]** of historical accident data to identify high-risk patterns and contributing factors.
* Assisted in the development and implementation of the Bayesian learning model for accident risk prediction.
* Worked with ESP8266-based client devices for in-vehicle data gathering and transmission mechanisms (Wi-Fi/GSM).
* Utilized ThingSpeak IoT platform for data aggregation, storage, and visualization, enabling real-time monitoring.
* Participated in evaluating model performance, including AUC-ROC, precision, and recall analysis.

## Technologies Used
* **IoT:** ESP8266, GSM/Wi-Fi communication
* **Cloud Platform:** ThingSpeak
* **Machine Learning:** Bayesian Learning techniques
* **Data Analysis:** Python, Pandas, **[Specific libraries for Bayesian modeling if used]**
* **Data Visualization:** ThingSpeak dashboards, **[Matplotlib/Seaborn if used for analysis]**

## Key Outcomes & Achievements
* Co-authored a peer-reviewed paper: "A Bayesian Learning Framework Powered by IoT for Enhancing Highway Safety and Reducing Accidents: A Case Study of Benin-Onitsha Express Way," published in the International Journal of Research in Information and Applied Sciences (IJRIAS).
* The developed Bayesian model achieved an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.82, indicating excellent discrimination between high-risk and low-risk areas.
* The system demonstrated 75% precision and 80% recall in risk prediction.
* A comparative analysis indicated a notable decrease in reported accidents (from 25 to 15 in the case study area) post-system deployment, suggesting a significant positive impact on safety.
