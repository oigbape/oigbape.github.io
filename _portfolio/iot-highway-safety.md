## Objective
To develop a predictive system leveraging IoT and Bayesian learning to enhance road safety and reduce accidents on the Benin-Onitsha Express Way, Nigeria, addressing the problem of frequent accidents.

## My Role & Contributions
* Collaborated on the conceptualization and design of the IoT framework, including the selection of appropriate hardware components (ESP8266, sensors) and the data transmission strategy (Wi-Fi/GSM).
* Participated in defining the methodology for analyzing three years of historical accident data to identify high-risk areas and key predictive features.
* Contributed to the aspects related to the application of Bayesian learning techniques for developing the accident risk prediction model.
* Assisted in the data flow design for transmitting vehicle data (location, speed, road conditions) to a central server and utilizing the ThingSpeak IoT platform for data storage, analysis, and visualization.
* Involved in the interpretation of results, including the model's performance metrics (AUC-ROC, precision, recall) and the analysis of the system's impact on accident reduction.
* Co-authored the research paper, contributing to sections related to methodology and system architecture.

## Technologies Used
* **IoT Hardware:** ESP8266-development board, SIM800L GSM module, GPS-uBlox Neo 6M, 16x2 I2C LCD, Buzzer.
* **IoT Platform:** ThingSpeak (for data storage, visualization, and real-time monitoring).
* **Machine Learning:** Bayesian Learning (specifically Na√Øve Bayes).
* **Programming/Development:** Arduino IDE (for programming NodeMCU ESP8266).
* **Data Communication:** Wi-Fi, GSM.

## Key Outcomes & Achievements
* Successfully co-developed an IoT framework and Bayesian learning model that effectively identified accident-prone locations, achieving an **AUC-ROC of 0.82**, demonstrating **75% precision and 80% recall** in predicting high-risk areas.
* System showed a **reduction in reported accidents from 25 to 15** in the monitored expressway segment after deployment, indicating a positive impact on highway safety.
* Peer-reviewed publication in the *International Journal of Research in Information and Applied Sciences (IJRIAS)*.
