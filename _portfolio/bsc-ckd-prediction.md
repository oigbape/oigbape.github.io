## Objective
To develop a machine learning model to predict the risk of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on a publicly available or provided clinical dataset, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the machine learning workflow.

## My Role & Contributions
* Performed comprehensive data preprocessing on the CKD dataset, including handling **[e.g., X%]** missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling using Pandas and Scikit-Learn.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize feature distributions, correlations, and identify potential outliers.
* Implemented and systematically evaluated several classification algorithms, such as **[e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forest]**, using Scikit-Learn.
* Optimized model hyperparameters using **[e.g., GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV]** to improve predictive performance.
* Analyzed feature importance scores from the best model to identify key physiological indicators contributing to CKD risk.

## Technologies Used
* **Programming:** Python
* **Data Manipulation & Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (for models like **[List specific models tried]**, preprocessing, evaluation metrics)

## Key Outcomes & Achievements
* Developed a predictive model (e.g., **[State best model, e.g., Random Forest]**) that achieved **[e.g., an accuracy of X% and an AUC score of Y]** on the unseen test set.
* Successfully identified **[e.g., 3-5]** significant predictors of CKD from the dataset, such as **[mention one or two if appropriate, e.g., blood pressure, glucose levels]**.
* Demonstrated proficiency in applying the end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data cleaning and EDA to model training, tuning, and evaluation.
* Performed comprehensive data cleaning, preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding), and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
