## Objective
To develop a machine learning model to predict the risk of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on a publicly available or provided clinical dataset, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the machine learning workflow.

## My Role & Contributions
* Performed comprehensive data preprocessing on the CKD dataset, including handling **[e.g., X%]** missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling using Pandas and Scikit-Learn.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize feature distributions, correlations, and identify potential outliers.
* Implemented and systematically evaluated several classification algorithms, such as **[e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forest]**, using Scikit-Learn.
* Optimized model hyperparameters using **[e.g., GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV]** to improve predictive performance.
* Analyzed feature importance scores from the best model to identify key physiological indicators contributing to CKD risk.

## Technologies Used
* **Programming:** Python
* **Data Manipulation & Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy(used by Pandas/Scikit-learn), SciPy
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (for `train_test_split`, `KNeighborsClassifier`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `GaussianNB`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `accuracy_score`, `precision_score`, `recall_score`, `f1_score`, `confusion_matrix`, `classification_report`)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Key Outcomes & Achievements
* Successfully implemented an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data acquisition and cleaning to model training, evaluation, and comparison.
* The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest performance with **98% accuracy, 97% precision, 100% recall, and a 98% F1-score** on the test set.
* The Decision Tree Classifier also performed well with 94% accuracy.
* Demonstrated effective data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to prepare a real-world medical dataset for machine learning.
* Gained practical experience in evaluating and comparing different classification models for a binary classification task.
