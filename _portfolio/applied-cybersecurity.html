## Objective
To gain practical experience in identifying, implementing, and analyzing common cybersecurity vulnerabilities and to understand the underlying principles of various attack vectors and cryptographic systems.

## My Role & Contributions
* Conducted hands-on labs to implement and demonstrate a range of attacks, including Hash Length Extension, SQL Injection, Buffer Overflows (stack-based), and Padding Oracle attacks.
* Analyzed the mechanics of each attack, identified vulnerable code patterns, and explored mitigation techniques.
* Developed proof-of-concept exploit scripts for **[e.g., 2-3]** of the studied vulnerabilities using **[e.g., Python]**.
* Studied and implemented basic functionalities related to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), RSA encryption/signatures, and Secret Key Encryption methods.
* Investigated SetUID program vulnerabilities and the principles of Format String attacks, documenting potential impacts and defenses.

## Technologies Used
* **Programming Languages:** C, Python, SQL
* **Tools:** GDB (GNU Debugger), **[Network analysis tools like Wireshark if used]**, **[Web proxy like Burp Suite if used]**
* **Concepts:** Vulnerability Assessment, Exploit Development, Cryptography (RSA, PKI, Symmetric Encryption), Secure Coding, Linux OS Security.

## Key Outcomes & Learnings
* Successfully executed **[e.g., 9]** distinct types of common cyberattacks in controlled environments.
* Gained practical understanding of how vulnerabilities are exploited and the importance of secure coding and system configuration.
* Strengthened skills in debugging, reverse engineering (basic), and cryptographic protocol analysis.
* Contributed **[e.g., X reports/presentations]** detailing attack methodologies and defense strategies.
