## Objective
To investigate and demonstrate the efficacy of using a rule-based Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system for analyzing petrophysical well log data to identify subsurface lithology and fluid content, aiming for faster and more comprehensive interpretations.

## My Role & Contributions
* Contributed to the research team by **[describe your specific tasks: e.g., assisting with the preparation and preprocessing of well log data provided by Shell Producing Development Company (SPDC) Nigeria, participating in the feature extraction or data clustering process using unsupervised neural networks, helping define/refine the fuzzy rule base, or performing validation of the system's output against known geological data]**.
* Involved in understanding and applying the Takagi-Sugeno inference arrangement and centroid of extent defuzzification techniques within the project's framework.
* Assisted in the analysis and interpretation of the results, which demonstrated the fuzzy system's capability to provide fast and comprehensive details of subsurface structures.
* Co-authored the resulting paper: "Takagi-Sugeno Integrated Fuzzy System in Subsurface Identification," published in the Covenant Journal of Physical and Life Sciences.

## Technologies Used
