 ## Objective
To apply advanced data engineering techniques, cloud platforms, and visualization tools to analyze complex datasets, build predictive models, and create interactive data-driven applications. For a specific project, to evaluate the impacts of district-level urban development on Guangdong Province's coastal water quality, specifically examining the transmission of these impacts through the river-sea interface to nearshore zones, and to identify key urban drivers. 

## Key Projects & Contributions
* **Urbanization Trend Visualization:**
    * Designed and developed interactive charts and choropleth maps using D3.js to visualize **[global/national/regional]** urbanization trends from **[specific data source, e.g., World Bank Data]**.
    * Processed and structured **[e.g., demographic/geospatial]** data to highlight key patterns and changes over a **[e.g., 20-year]** period, enabling dynamic exploration.
* **Large-Scale Data Processing & Machine Learning Applications:**
    * Utilized Apache Spark on DataBricks/Azure to process and analyze **[e.g., X GB/TB]** of **[type of data, e.g., simulated weblog data or public dataset name]**.
    * Implemented algorithms such as PageRank for network analysis and Random Forest (Scikit-Learn) for **[e.g., classification/regression tasks on Y dataset]**, achieving **[quantifiable result, e.g., Z% accuracy/AUC score]**.
* **Data Application Development & Cloud Deployment:**
    * Built a **[e.g., web application/API]** using Flask to serve model predictions or display interactive visualizations (Tableau/D3.js) derived from data managed in SQLite and cleaned with OpenRefine.
    * Leveraged Microsoft Azure cloud services for scalable data storage and compute; utilized Docker for containerizing **[e.g., the Flask application or processing scripts]** to ensure reproducible environments.
* **LLM Exploration:**
    * Investigated the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for **[e.g., automated data summarization, natural language querying of structured data, or feature engineering]** within a selected project context.

## Technologies Used
* **Big Data & Processing:** Apache Spark, DataBricks
* **Cloud Platforms:** Microsoft Azure
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Databases:** SQLite
* **Data Cleaning:** OpenRefine
* **Web Framework:** Flask
* **Machine Learning:** PageRank Algorithm, Random Forest, Scikit-Learn, LLMs
* **Visualization:** D3.js, Tableau

## Key Outcomes & Learnings
* Successfully processed and visualized large datasets to extract meaningful insights regarding **[e.g., urbanization patterns or specified domain]**.
* Developed and deployed **[e.g., 1-2]** machine learning models on a cloud platform, demonstrating understanding of the end-to-end data science lifecycle.
* Gained hands-on experience with a modern data stack including distributed computing, containerization, cloud services, and advanced visualization.
