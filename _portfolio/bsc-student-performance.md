## Objective
To conduct a comparative analysis of various data mining techniques to predict student academic performance and identify key factors influencing student success, aiming to provide insights for potential interventions.

## My Role & Contributions
* Collected, cleaned, and preprocessed a dataset comprising **[e.g., N hundred/thousand]** student records with demographic, socio-economic, and past academic features.
* Implemented and systematically evaluated **[e.g., 3-4]** different classification algorithms, such as **[e.g., Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors]**, using **[Python with Scikit-Learn, or Weka/R - specify primary tools]**.
* Performed feature selection and engineering to identify the most impactful predictors of academic success.
* Compared models based on key metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, identifying **[e.g., Random Forest/Decision Tree]** as the best-performing model for the given dataset.
* Derived actionable insights from the analysis, such as identifying that **[e.g., factors X and Y were most correlated with high/low performance]**, suggesting areas for student support.

## Technologies Used
* **Primary Tools:** **[Python (Scikit-Learn, Pandas), Weka, R - specify clearly]**
* **Data Mining Algorithms:** **[Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN - list specific ones used and compared]**
* **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering Techniques**
* **Model Evaluation Metrics** (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## Key Outcomes & Achievements
* The **[e.g., chosen algorithm, e.g., Decision Tree]** model achieved an accuracy of **[e.g., X%]** in predicting student performance categories (e.g., high, medium, low).
* Identified **[e.g., top 3-5]** key factors significantly impacting academic outcomes, providing a data-driven basis for potential early intervention strategies within an educational setting.
* Successfully demonstrated the application and comparative evaluation of multiple data mining techniques to a real-world educational dataset.
